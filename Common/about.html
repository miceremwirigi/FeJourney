    <p>Me? What about?</p>    
    <p>Oh, that. I love coffee. I loove love cofee.</p>
    <p>
      In fact, I am bananas about coffee, crazy about dancing and
      enthusiastic about excercise. I have my morning runs 
      every weekday, after which I dance through some 
      calisthenic workouts as I listen to my favourite radio
      show; classic 105. Surely you can guess what I 
      take after that.

    <p>I am a tech fanatic, currently taking a Bsc. Miomedical
      engineering degree at Kenyatta University in Kenya. I'm
      also a self taught electronics tecnician, running a part-time
      service business for repair and maintenance of mobile phones,
      laptops and desktop computers. 
     </p>
     <p> Well, I also really like to get to the bottom of things with
      kitchenware if you know what I mean. It's such 'arommantic' 
      moments that I live for.</p>
    
    <p>I'd love to hear from you</p>
